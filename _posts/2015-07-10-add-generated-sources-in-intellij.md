title: Add generated-sources directory into intellij
---
In case you are using protobuf,gradle and intellij, everytime, when refresh the project, i.e, generated-sources folder is not included in intellij, which causes intellij can't index source files generated by protobuf-compiler. I have to manually include it in intellij, which is not a good user experience.

Adding the following snip into build.gradle, will solve the issue:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'idea'
ext {
    protobufOutputDir = file("$buildDir/generated-sources/main")
}
idea.module {
    excludeDirs -= file("$buildDir")
    sourceDirs += protobufOutputDir
}
```
